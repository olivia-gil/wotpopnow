    <td>Pretty mint. Greggs own brand soft drinks usually bang. Good balance of sweet and sour. But I’ll probably keep going for Florida Orange in the future.</td>

    <td>Despite the fact this drink contains ZERO SUGAR, it is so disgustingly sweet it actually hurt my mouth a little. Imagine a concentrate of strawberry ice lollies, straight up. I do not know what is in this drink, but as I checked the back I realised that this drink is NOT VEGETARIAN. Somehow! I do not know! I am scarred! I am shaken! But I do it all for you.</td>

    <td>Lucozade Sport</td>
    <td>Fruit Punch</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>Summer in a bottle! Tastes very similar to raspberry and apple J2O - delicious and refreshing. The flavours are perfectly balanced and works very well as a non-carbonated drink as this really allows the sweetness and the tart berry to come through. I’m also a fan of a squeezy-cap bottle and I don’t care if that makes me childish. All in all a very *chefs kiss* experience. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Dr Pepper</td>
    <td>Dark Berry</td>
    <td>?</td>
    <td>I think it’s time to give up with Dr Pepper variations. If I concentrate hard enough I can maybe wish a faint whisper of ‘dark berry’ into existence, but quite frankly this just tastes like a can of Dr Pepper. I have no idea what to rate it because I love Dr Pepper (10/10) but I was sold a fruity lie. The Dr has disappointed me once again. </td>

    <td>Fanta</td>
    <td>Fruit Punch</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>Was okay I guess. I thought the watermelon and strawberry was a bit of a haphazard combination that didn’t entirely fit. Watermelon was a tad strong even for me. Overall okay. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dalstons</td>
    <td>Cherry</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td> Dalston’s at it again with the interestingly fresh takes on old classics. They mean it when they say sweet and sour too! Very sweet, but offset by the tartness of the sour cherries. Cherryade was my favourite pop growing up, but now I find it a tad too boring. This is a good replacement! </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Coca-Cola</td>
    <td>Coffee</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>The only kind of person who would buy a Coffee flavoured Coke is clearly someone full of self-loathing and on a determined path to diarrhoea. It tastes exactly as you would imagine - like coffee mixed with coke. Somewhat less disgusting than I thought it would be but certainly not enjoyable.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vita</td>
    <td>Peach</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>Is iced tea really a ‘pop’? This can be debated in the comments. What isn’t up for debate, however, is how refreshing this was! A nice take on a classic peach. A little overly sweet for me and nothing too titillating about the flavour profile, but pleasant nonetheless. Would make a great hangover pick-me-up!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fanta</td>
    <td>Sarsi</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>We two fools were tricked by the juicy exterior of this liquid Trojan Horse. Little did we know inside this appealing packaging lies a violent sarsaparilla that disappointed us to our core. That being said, this wasn’t the most offensive Sarsi I’ve tried, but shall avoid this and all other mouthwash flavoured beverages at all costs.</td>
