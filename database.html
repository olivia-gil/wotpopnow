    <td>Greggs Sparkling Cherryade</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>Pretty mint. Greggs own brand soft drinks usually bang. Good balance of sweet and sour. But I’ll probably keep going for Florida Orange in the future.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Millions Fizzy Strawberry</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Despite the fact this drink contains ZERO SUGAR, it is so disgustingly sweet it actually hurt my mouth a little. Imagine a concentrate of strawberry ice lollies, straight up. I do not know what is in this drink, but as I checked the back I realised that this drink is NOT VEGETARIAN. Somehow! I do not know! I am scarred! I am shaken! But I do it all for you.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lucozade Sport Fruit Punch</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>Summer in a bottle! Tastes very similar to raspberry and apple J2O - delicious and refreshing. The flavours are perfectly balanced and works very well as a non-carbonated drink as this really allows the sweetness and the tart berry to come through. I’m also a fan of a squeezy-cap bottle and I don’t care if that makes me childish. All in all a very *chefs kiss* experience. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dr Pepper Dark Berry</td>
    <td>?</td>
    <td>I think it’s time to give up with Dr Pepper variations. If I concentrate hard enough I can maybe wish a faint whisper of ‘dark berry’ into existence, but quite frankly this just tastes like a can of Dr Pepper. I have no idea what to rate it because I love Dr Pepper (10/10) but I was sold a fruity lie. The Dr has disappointed me once again. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fanta Fruit Punch</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>Was okay I guess. I thought the watermelon and strawberry was a bit of a haphazard combination that didn’t entirely fit. Watermelon was a tad strong even for me. Overall okay. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dalstons Cherry</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td> Dalston’s at it again with the interestingly fresh takes on old classics. They mean it when they say sweet and sour too! Very sweet, but offset by the tartness of the sour cherries. Cherryade was my favourite pop growing up, but now I find it a tad too boring. This is a good replacement! </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Coca-Cola Coffee</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>The only kind of person who would buy a Coffee flavoured Coke is clearly someone full of self-loathing and on a determined path to diarrhoea. It tastes exactly as you would imagine - like coffee mixed with coke. Somewhat less disgusting than I thought it would be but certainly not enjoyable.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vita Peach</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>Is iced tea really a ‘pop’? This can be debated in the comments. What isn’t up for debate, however, is how refreshing this was! A nice take on a classic peach. A little overly sweet for me and nothing too titillating about the flavour profile, but pleasant nonetheless. Would make a great hangover pick-me-up!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fanta Sarsi</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>We two fools were tricked by the juicy exterior of this liquid Trojan Horse. Little did we know inside this appealing packaging lies a violent sarsaparilla that disappointed us to our core. That being said, this wasn’t the most offensive Sarsi I’ve tried, but shall avoid this and all other mouthwash flavoured beverages at all costs.</td>

    <td>Club Mate</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>Tasted like bong water</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Grace Mighty Malt</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>A jarring combination of non-alcoholic Carling, smoke and caramel, with distinct notes of a hangover piss. One sip was more than enough and I shan’t be running back for more. Truly hideous. Only avoids a rating of 0 thanks to Castleford malt factory nostalgia.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Nix and Kix Cucumber Mint</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>A very savoury flavour that really shouldn’t work, but does! A classic English flavour with a fiery cayenne kick.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fanta Apple</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>Does what it says on the tin. I’m refreshed. I’m unexcited. Grab an Apple Tango instead.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fanta Fruit Cream Soda</td>
    <td>8.5</td>
    <td>A very pleasant surprise. Imagine carbonated tutti-frutti bubble gum... but delicious. The bright green colour was a little intimidating at first but it didn’t dampen the overall experience of this incredibly refreshing drink. Maybe not for everyone in all it’s artificial glory but for me it adds a fun new twist to the typically saccharine flavour of cream soda.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>La Croix Berry</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>I’ll be the first to admit I’m not a fan of flavoured waters and of most I’ve tried this had to be one of the best. But it was pretty boring and I would have liked a stronger Berry flavour. For those of you who somehow enjoy the taste of carbon dioxide, I’m sure this is the one for you. Living for this Beverly Hills aesthetic tho.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vinea</td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>Absolutely delicious, I was struggling to believe that it was solely grape that went into this exceptional beverage as the flavour profile was so complex. I got definite notes of elderflower and the ability to get that solely out of grape juice is a testament to the skill of this company. This is in Prague McDonalds, so when you’re next there check it out!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Appletiser Exotic Lime and Apple Spritzer</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>I am unsure as to what makes a lime ‘exotic’, I’d have assumed exoticism is an innate quality of a lime. However, this drink was fine. I thought the strong lime flavour completely overpowered the more delicate apple flavour. But not bad!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Diet Coke Twisted Strawberry</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>I’m not usually a fan of Diet Coke so I went into this with reservations, however this definitely tasted better than original Diet Coke, it was far more flavoursome, and not as overly sweet as you’d expect for something strawberry flavoured.
        Regarding the flavour, I wonder if the name “twisted strawberry” is a homage to twister ice lollies, as this is the taste I am reminded very strongly of, rather than of strawberries themselves. It had a good level of carbonation and as it was a mini can was the right amount to enjoy it without having enough to feel gassy. Overall the most exciting part of this drink is the aesthetically pleasing pink design of the can, and that it was given out for free at a stand. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fentimans Sparkling Elderflower</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>Wow! Really, really delicious! I may be a little biased as a huge lover of elderflower, but I’ll be the first to say that it can be one note and flat. The subtle addition fermented ginger root extract here adds a beautiful and complex foundation to this delicate sweetness that I couldn’t get enough of. A botanical bonanza you must try!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>San Pellegrino Limone + Tea</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>A nice concept, they’re going big on the organic ingredients which I like. But small size due to the sugar tax means it would barely quench the thirst of a pygmy mouse. Also not enough tea flavour. I liked the gentle sparkle but missed the punchy impact of the black tea flavour that you get from a bottle of Liptons. Overall, ok but wouldn’t rush back for more.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>San Pellegrino Essenza Tangerine and Strawberry</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Pretty terrible. A strange mix of sickly strawberry with a mismatched orange aftertaste and an over-dry soda. Flavoured sparkling waters can work! But sadly not in this case. Beautiful can tho.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mirinda Citris</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>Pretty OK! Standard lemon and lime flavour, not too sweet, not too tart. Pretty aaaaaaaaaaaallright.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Innocent Bubbles Sparkling Apple and Berry</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>Although I was a massive fan of this one big trips and co disagreed. I enjoyed a great complexity and depth of flavour; from the freshness of the apple, to the sweetness of the berries, the citrus tang of the mandarin and the smooth undercurrent of grape. A highly texturised taste I would have given a 10, but mob mentality rules.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Schweppes Grapefruit and Blood Orange</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>Delicious! The zing of the blood orange offsets the bitterness of the grapefruit perfectly, creating a gorgeous and refreshing citrus medley.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>St Helier Passionfruit and Mango</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>Bootleg San Pellegrino? Maybe. Do I care? Absolutely not. A delicious and tropical (if *slightly* artificial) hit of flavour perfectly balanced with subtle carbonation. Sweet, fruity, and refreshing - and only 40p in Savers! Downed it in minutes and can’t wait to go back and try the other flavours.</td>
 </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fanta Grape</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>I’m usually not a big fan of grape soda but this was quite tasty! A fizzy, sherberty, sweet flavour that may get a bit sickly after a while, but definitely my favourite grape I’ve tried. Worth a try!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fanta Blood Orange</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>Quite disappointed in this one. With blood orange you expect that sort of understated zing that is just not developed at all in this. A lazy flavour profile with a cough syrup orange flavour. Stick to limón. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dr Pepper Cherry</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>Can’t go much wrong with a Dr P. Easily the best soft drink in the game. Mixing it up with an extra nudge of Cherry was an exciting change. But why change a masterpiece?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dalston's Lemonade</td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>Might I say, this is by far the most tasty lemonade variety I’ve tried. It’s difficult to make something as ubiquitous as lemonade make you take notice. But Dalston’s had the perfect mix of sugar and acid that is so so difficult to attain. Definitely worth a try.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Heartsease Farm Apple and Rhubard</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>A very safe and predictable cloudy apple flavour with none of the rhubarb kick I was craving. Really need to take a good look at themselves and crank this bitch up to 11 IMO.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lucozade Cherry</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>Just okay. Sarah has requested this one for a long time, but I never really had high expectations. It avoided the cough syrup cherry flavour that I utterly detest, and instead went into the territory of a melted down cherry maoam. Won’t be overtaking the orange or original any time soon. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Evian Fruits and Plants Raspberry</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>Very tasty, but really just an overpriced flavoured water. Raspberry flavour was not very complex, and has that yoghurty feel I can take or leave. Buy the 50p own brand bottles instead and do yourself a favour.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Heartsease Farm Raspberry Lemonade</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>Now this was disappointing. I’m not sure why but I had very high hopes for this one; I expected a sharp, tart lemonade balanced well with notes of summer berry. This expectation even lasted after opening - it smells delicious! But upon tasting, this pop is very meh. Inoffensive but forgettable. The artificial sweetener is uncomfortably juxtaposed with the delicate flavours. Worst of all is the pathetic attempt at carbonation - the barely-there-fizz is just about detectable but adds nothing exciting. Perfectly drinkable but not one I’ll be returning to. Slightly weird aftertaste too!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>F&N Sarsi</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>As I’m not a fan of root beer/sarsaparilla, I was never going to be a massive fan of this. However, it seemed a rather standard root beer, very prominent wintergreen flavour. You should probably just go for an A&W. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>VitaSoy</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>I was very afraid to try this but it was surprisingly palatable. A nice sweet ovaltine flavour, I imagine would go down great with my grandma. Smell reminded me of the old Malt Kiln down in Castleford where I used to live. Overall not too bad, but probably not something I’d choose again.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Vita Chrysanthemum Tea </td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>I can say in all my life I don’t think I’ve ever come across a drink as demonically bad. Please don’t think I’m exaggerating when I say this is the most grotesque liquid that has ever gone in my mouth (and that’s saying a lot lol). Imagine emptying an old rusty lawn mower of all its rotting mulch, and then make a tea with it. Stew this tea for about 6 months, and lightly chill. This is what I imagine Vita do to recreate this spot-on plant flavour. As that is all it tastes of. Plant. Buy for your enemies. </td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Bottle Green Sparkling Pressé Tropical Mango and Coconut</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Vile, there’s no other words. I am convinced the Bottle Green factory must also produce air freshener and there has been some tragic mixup. The exact aroma of Malibu sun cream and not appetising in the slightest. I don’t get any mango at all, just horrendously flat and penetrating coconut. Avoid avoid avoid.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Pokka Cookies and Cream</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Offensive, I likened it to the vomit of a baby who just ate a Farley’s rusk + a load of sugar. Aftertaste was somehow even worse, and gave me a good long stomach ache for about 45 minutes after. Would not recommend unless you’re committing penance for something severely grievous.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Levi Roots Jamaican Sunset</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>Tasty, but a tad bland. Very strong watermelon flavour but the guava fails to come through at all, more zest would help relieve some of the banality of this beverage. Expect more from Levi really. </td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Franklin and Sons Dandelion and Burdock</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>I was very pleasantly surprised! The star anise is a beautiful addition to the deep sweet botanical flavours of the English countryside, and a lovely addition to a tee-total Xmas. </td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Lemoncocco</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Pretty grim ngl, obviously trying to go for a tropical piña colada vibe, just the lemon and coconut together don’t mesh, pineapple is sorely needed to connect between the soft and the sharp.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Boylan Diet Black Cherry Soda</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>A little over essential and cough-syrupy. Tolerable lasting taste, that wasn’t entirely unenjoyable but nothing I’m running back for. Although black cherry is a difficult flavour to balance, and this was a good effort.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Fanta Grapefruit</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>Can’t really go wrong with grapefruit, a perfect balance between sweetness and tang. Sometimes keeping it simple is what’s best. </td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Breckland Orchard Dandelion and Burdock Posh Pop</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>God awful. All the bitterness of the burdock with no sweetness to balance, closer to root beer than D&B in my book, a huge disappointment. I appreciate natural flavours but not at the expense of taste. Malt flavour overdone.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Coca Cola Cinnamon</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>Wasn’t as bad as I first assumed, actually quite tasty but a bit of a flat flavour you just get a bit bored of. Very slight cinnamon flavour that wasn’t overwhelming but perfectly managed to be underwhelming.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Jarritos Mandarin Soda</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>A zesty little number. A rather straightforward orangeade with a Mexican twist. Nothing to write home about.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>San Pelligrino Blood Orange</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>A heavy weekend required a heavy cure. A fun twist on a classic, that refreshed my dessicated body. I just wish I had more!</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Calypso Kiwi Lemonade</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>The unnatural presentation unnerved us slightly, unsure as to why lemon pulp was added as it took up the radioactive green dye, making the drink look rather unappealing and almost plastic. I really enjoyed the lemon tang but feel this drink failed to amalgamate both kiwi and citrus flavours. Perhaps the addition of a sharper flavour such as cranberry may have helped unite these two poles. Very much enjoyed drinking out of glass.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Fanta Elderflower</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>The hungover pop binge continues. I’m famously a massive fan of botanical flavours, and this did not disappoint. A soft floral sweetness I couldn’t get enough of.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Bundaberg Pink Grapefruit</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>Absolutely delicious; fresh and not too dry. I would’ve maybe liked a little more zing, but overall very enjoyable.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Fanta Pineapple</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>Really delicious! Authentic juicy pineapple flavour with a delectable sweet softness lingering on the tongue. A perfect fizzy tropical sweet treat as winter creeps ever closer.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Rubicon Street Drinks African Inspired Bissap</td>
    <td>9.5</td>
    <td>This one was a shock to the system. Slightly sour at first, but once the palate acclimatised it was truly a wonderful taste experience. Aromatically sweet hibiscus mixed with fiery ginger gave me a warm tummy on these cold autumn days in the library.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Old Jamaica Grape Soda</td>
    <td>2.5</td>
    <td>Overly artificial sweetness with unpleasant sherbet aftertaste.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Coca Cola Zero Peach</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Gross! Horrendous artificial peach flavour! Avoid at all costs! Coke really need to go back to basics and stop experimenting with these fad flavours, bring back lime coke!</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Rubicon Street Drinks Turkish Inspired Sharbat</td>
    <td>7.5</td>
    <td>Although I enjoyed this drink immensely, the pomegranate flavour is just right and not over sweet, I’m lacking the botanical punch of rose I was expecting. Tasty, but safe.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Rubicon Street Drinks Mexican Inspired Agua Fresca</td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>A true flavour experience, if I shut my eyes I’m on a beach in cancun. The flawless combination of some of my favourite flavours; the soft watermelon is warmed by the delicately sweet mint flavour, which is then beautifully undercut by the zesty lime. Bravo!</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Ocean Bomb Cider Flavour</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>One word: Blah. Overly saccharine, lacking any complex flavouring, lacking any bloody excitement. Cute packaging tho. Yawn.</td>

    <td>San Pellegrino Orange and Prickly Pear</td>
    <td>8.5</td>
    <td>I always get very excited whenever I see pear and citrus paired together. An unlikely combination you wouldn’t think would work, however the soft juicy sweetness of the pair offsets the citrus tang of the orange perfectly. The prickly pear flavour is even juicier and mellow than a standard variety.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Shani</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Limca</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>I fear in my curiosity at this bottle, which looked like it just washed up on shore after many weeks at sea, I may have accidentally bought Indian liquid Rennie. Powdery lemon flavour that’s not very palatable. But not utterly distasteful.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Drench Juicy Spring Water Strawberry and Lime</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Words cannot describe how utterly vile this is. Usually even the drinks I don’t relatively enjoy I manage to finish. However, this I managed around 3 sips before giving up. The utterly flat lime flavour gives the saccharine strawberry an almost rotten taste. DISGUSTENG. </td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Oasis AquaShock Spicy Raspberry</td>
    <td>6.5</td>
    <td>Outlandish claims appear unfulfilled. I’ve had my eye on this beverage for a while, and anything less than a flavour explosion was going to be a disappointment in my book. A soft yoghurt-y raspberry flavour with an ever so mild after-tingle. But still an enjoyable beverage.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>John Crabbie & Co Scottish Raspberry with a twist of ginger, Bristol</td>
    <td>7.5</td>
    <td>As much as I did appreciate the vintage feel of this beverage and the authentic raspberry taste, I felt a touch let down by the lack of a fiery ginger kick. I expected a firework, but was left with a sparkler. Although the hint of ginger did warm up the delicate sweetness of the raspberry, and made this a rather tasty drink.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Ugly Lemon and Lime</td>
    <td>5.5</td>
    <td>The citrus zing cut through some of the monotony of the Perrier-esque flavour, and as a result was a touch more palatable. Although wouldn’t be rushing back to buy this anytime soon.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Ugly Triple Berry</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>I was very excited to give this one a try. New soda brands always manage to peak my interest. The garish packaging indicated explosive flavour, but failed to deliver. I couldn’t even say this drink had a hint of berry, it was more of a breath. Not unpleasant, but ultimately as boring as a simple Perrier. Appreciate the low sugar content, but not at the expense of flavour.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Cawston Press Rhubarb and Apple</td>
    <td>8.5</td>
    <td>Delicious. Toes the line of tart and sharpness, with delectably sweet after-notes. Refreshingly classic English flavours make for an overall refreshing experience. Best enjoyed with friends.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Lemony Lemonade</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>Bitch! It’s lemonade! What do you want me to say? Appreciate that it’s fair trade, but really tastes like any other lemonade on the market. Ethical zest.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Fuzetea Peach Hibiscus</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>I must say that this was extremely refreshing and not too sweet. Hibiscus flavours can often be overwhelming, however in this drink I found the sharpness to be a very delicate accompaniment to the soft peach flavour. Handy hangover helper.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Fentiman’s Cherry Cola</td>
    <td>8.5</td>
    <td>A risk with cola beverages is that the taste often falls flat, and they often rely far too heavily on sugar for taste. Fentimans, as usual, fails to disappoint. The addition of a delectable ginger root flavour gives a real depth to a beverage many think of as mundane. The interaction between the ginger root and the cherry offsets any unwanted “cough-syrup” flavours. I just wish the bottle were bigger!</td>

    <td>Kimura Ramune Lychee </td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>Fans of Wotpopnow understand my dedication to the quantification of taste. I’m not here to make friends, I’m here to truthfully review sodas. Some call my reviews too harsh. But how can we expect more from society, when we refuse to raise the bar? Today, I feel all my work has been worth it. Today I found the true 10/10. A 10/10 is not just great taste, it’s a great overall original experience. On that front, this drink delivers entirely. Delicious, fizzy, fun, and the reason I’m in this game to begin with.</td>

    <td>Fentimans Rose Lemonade</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>On initial tasting I was unsure as to whether the strong and sharp rose and lemon flavours were entirely compatible. However, over time the flavour combination amalgamated into something exciting, fresh, and botanical. A real experience of English summertime captured within a glass bottle.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Sprite Lemon Lime and Cucumber</td>
    <td>8.5</td>
    <td>Although I feel the cucumber flavour in this drink would be appreciated a touch more if it were a tad drier, I think this is a very fun summer-y twist on a classic. Cool cucumber aftertaste makes me long for northern sunshine. Enjoy with gin and ice in your rainy English garden and pray for sun.</td>

    <td>Canada Dry Cranberry Ginger Ale</td>
    <td>8.5</td>
    <td>Similar flavour profile to that of the Blackberry ginger beer, but replacing the sherbert-y fizz, and a slight bitter cranberry kick that proves very enjoyable. Would make a fantastic vodka cocktail.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Mix by Sprite Tropic Berry</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Tastes and smells exactly like Lemonade flavour Four Loko. Sent me in a tailspin of drunken flashbacks and regrets. Would not recommend.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Fanta Berry</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>One word: mediocre. The off-putting neon blue colouring gives off the idea of a zany flavour, but falls painfully short. Bland and sugary, with no real punch. However, still drinkable.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Brio Aranciata Rossa Soda</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>Disappointing cough syrup orange flavour. Save yourself the money and buy orange crush. Totally drinkable, but entirely unenjoyable.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Island Soda Kola Champagne</td>
    <td>9.5</td>
    <td>Absolutely delicious. A bizzare blend of cream soda and irn bru, that somehow works perfectly.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Arizona Kiwi Strawberry Fruit Juice Cocktail</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>Kiwi and strawberry is one of my favourite flavour combinations so this was always going to be a win for me. However, Arizona is lucky I don’t deduct points for excessive sugar content. Diabetics beware.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Sumol Pineapple</td>
    <td>7.5</td>
    <td>Though I preferred the Passionfruit, this was still very tasty! Not much to say on this one, just sweet and satisfying. I’d have preferred a bit more tang.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Diet Coke Lime and Ginger</td>
    <td>6.5</td>
    <td>Although I enjoyed the ginger and lime flavours together, I couldn’t help thinking this drink doesn’t go far enough flavour wise. I would’ve loved to have had a more fiery ginger flavour and a more zesty lime taste, as after the first few sips of this drink the power of the two flavours just fades. Would recommend to those who enjoy an essence of ginger flavour, but without the fire.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Diet Coke Mango</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>Although I feel I definitely preferred the blood orange flavour, this drink still stands it’s own. Fruity and fun flavour that would KILL with rum. Must-try mixer.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Sada Soursop Juice Drink</td>
    <td>6.5</td>
    <td>I had never heard of this fruit before. Took a bit of getting used to. Would describe as a mix between coconut water and mango juice. Would make a very tasty cocktail. Though probably won’t replace my OJ. </td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Sumol Passionfruit</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>You can’t really go wrong with Passionfruit. Delectably sweet and refreshing, but not at all excessive. Great accompaniment to zingy Portuguese flavours.</td>

    <td>OKF Aloe and Pomegranate</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>Nice juicy fruity flavour, but the aloe bits make me feel uncomfortable. Shame as I am such a pomegranate fan. But, is totally drinkable and quite delicious.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Diet Coke Blood Orange</td>
    <td>7.5</td>
    <td>Subtle orange flavour takes a bit of getting used to, but is entirely enjoyable. Refreshing new take on an old classic.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Fruit2O Lime Twist: Blueberry and Lime</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Actually horrible. Tastes like a melted down ice pop mixed with sherbet. Blue colour is quite off putting. Would not recommend.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>GoodDrink Organic Grapefruit Spritzer</td>
    <td>5.5</td>
    <td>As a big fan of grapefruit I was quite disappointed in this drink. Very bland, and lacking any sort of complex flavours you associate with grapefruit. Entirely drinkable, but nothing special.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Peach Peace Tea</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>Definitely my favourite flavour of Peace Tea I’ve tried so far. Really gets that juicy, nectar-y, peach flavour spot on.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Canada Dry Limited Edition BlackBerry Ginger Ale</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>I was pessimistic going into this one as I’m not a fan of ginger ale, however I was impressed by how well the blackberry and the ginger flavours went together. The ginger was subtle, but added a great spice that offset the sweetness of the blackberry. Get it while it’s available!</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Raspberry Peace Iced Tea</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>Refreshing and cool, prefer this raspberry flavour to lemon. Would recommend for a big thirst quencher.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Lemon Peace Tea</td>
    <td>7.5</td>
    <td>Taste doesn’t differ much from any other lemon ice teas on the market. However, though the taste is simple it is done well. Sweetness is not overwhelming. Slightly boring for my taste. </td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Guarana Antarctica</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>Although I’ve never been a fan of the over sweetness of guarana flavoured drinks, I found this to be just the right amount of sweetness. Tropical flavour brightened up a miserable Montreal winter day. Could have been fizzier.</td>
  </td>

    <td>Dry Sparkling Malali Watermelon Flavour</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>Sweet watermelon Flavour is offset beautifully by the dryness of the drink.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Stewart’s Key Lime Soda, Montreal</td>
    <td>6.5</td>
    <td>Great for anyone with a sweet tooth. Found it to be more appetising than cream soda due to the acidity of the lime. Did taste exactly like key lime pie! Would be great as a float.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Dry Sparkling Blood Orange Flavour</td>
    <td>6.5</td>
    <td>Refreshing, but orange flavours fail to come through sufficiently for my taste. Would describe as a more tolerable and less bitter alternative to Perrier. Light and fresh taste. Would go well with gin.</td>
  </td>
  <tr>
    <td>Cranberry Sprite</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>Cranberry and lemon-lime flavour go surprisingly well together. Would recommend for when very thirsty.</td>
